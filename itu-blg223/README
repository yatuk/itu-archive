# ITU BLG223 - Data Structures

This repository contains my coursework and implementations for the **BLG 223 - Data Structures** course at Istanbul Technical University (ITU). The course covers fundamental data structures and algorithms, emphasizing efficiency and practical applications.

## Contents
- **Assignments:** Implementations of various data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Projects:** Larger-scale coding projects applying data structures to solve complex problems.
- **Lecture Notes & Resources:** Additional materials, explanations, and sample problems.

## Topics Covered
- Arrays and Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs, Heaps, AVL Trees)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, Shortest Path Algorithms)
- Hash Tables
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms

## Setup & Usage
To compile and run the C/C++ programs in this repository, use the following commands:

```sh
# Compile the program
g++ -o main main.cpp

# Run the program
./main
```

## Notes
- The implementations are written in **C and C++**.
- No STL (Standard Template Library) was used unless explicitly required.
- The code follows ITU's academic integrity guidelines.

## License
This repository is for educational purposes. Feel free to use it for learning, but do not submit the code as your own in academic settings.
