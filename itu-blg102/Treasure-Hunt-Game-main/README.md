# Maze Treasure Hunt

## Objective
This program simulates a character navigating through a maze to locate the treasure room.

## How to Play
1. The initial letter of your name will represent the character in the game, and the character will always be located in the center of the room.
2. Rooms are square-shaped. In each iteration, the dimensions of the next room will be obtained from the user. The user should input the length of a single wall, which must be an odd number and greater than or equal to 5 units. The program will not proceed until a valid wall length is inputted.
3. The walls of the rooms will be represented by the ‘#’ character, except for the treasure room, which will be represented by the ‘$’ character.
4. At the start of the program, the number of steps needed to reach the treasure room will be randomly determined. The quickest path to the treasure is in the 4th step, while the longest path takes 8 steps. The selection of the treasure room will be randomly done based on these criteria.

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.

## Instructions
Follow the prompts to input the dimensions of each room and navigate through the maze to find the treasure room represented by '$'.

## Note
Enjoy the adventure and happy treasure hunting!
